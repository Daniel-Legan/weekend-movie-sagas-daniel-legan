# PROJECT NAME

Weekend Movie Sagas

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Sprint_

For our week 12 weekend challenge, we were given the task to create an application that would display a list of movie posters and titles. When clicked, the application goes to its details page with all the information associated with that movie.

## Challenges

This was the first time looking at many-to-many databases and how to SELECT relevant information from them with a proper SQL request. Also, keeping an eye on where data/state is stored was a new hurdle to overcome as we just learned about Redux-Saga during the week. 

## Usage

1. User may click on a movie poster and get the movie description and genre(s) associated with it.

## Built With

Visual Studio Code JavaScript, CSS, HTML, SQL, Express, Postgres, React, Redux, Redux-Saga
